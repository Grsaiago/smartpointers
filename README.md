# smartpointers
This is a study on self freeing pointers based on Snaipe's work.

My main goal is to have a better understanding on a possible implementation of smart pointers in C.
I highly suggest checking out Snaipe's work (https://github.com/Snaipe/libcsptr & https://snai.pe/posts/c-smart-pointers)
